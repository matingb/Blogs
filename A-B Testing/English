A/B Testing with Split: What It Is and Why You Should Use It to Enhance Your Decisions
Have you ever made a change to your system without knowing if it was the right move? This is one of the reasons why A/B testing has become a popular practice for optimizing digital products. Platforms like Split not only simplify its implementation but also take it to the next level by streamlining the management of your experiments.
In this blog, weâ€™ll explain how A/B testing works and explore how Split makes it easier to implement while keeping your code clean and your team productive.
What Is A/B Testing?
Before diving in, letâ€™s start with the basics: What is A/B testing?
Itâ€™s a technique used to compare two versions of an element to determine which one produces better results. For example, imagine a webpage with a red button (Version A). You decide to test how users respond to a blue button (Version B). In this case, the test involves splitting users into two groups: one sees Version A, while the other sees Version B. You then evaluate which one performs better based on a defined metric, such as click-through rate.
At the end of the test, the button with the highest click-to-view ratio is declared the winner and remains on the page.
ðŸ’¡ Splitâ€™s Advantage: Unlike a manual implementation, Split makes it easy to run tests with more than two versions simultaneously, speeding up experimentation and result analysis.

Benefits Beyond Immediate Results
While A/B testing is well-known for enabling data-driven decisions, its benefits go much further.
Safely Deploy Incomplete Features
Thanks to feature flags, you can deploy changes in production while keeping them hidden from users while they are tested with a controlled group. This allows you to continue with other releases without waiting for a feature to be 100% ready. This reduces risks, accelerates development cycles, and eliminates the stress of last-minute or overnight releases.
For example, if you're working on a new UI, modifying backend architecture, or implementing critical improvements, you can roll them out only to a small subset of users or even just your internal team. This way, you can identify and fix potential issues before they affect your entire user base, without delaying the release of other features.
Instant Rollback for Failed Experiments
Another major benefit of feature flags is the ability to instantly roll back changes without requiring a new deployment.
Deploying with feature flags isnâ€™t just useful for tracking metrics, it also enhances system security and reliability. If a feature fails or an experiment doesnâ€™t produce the expected results, reverting it is quick and easy. 
ðŸ’¡ Efficient Management with Split â†’ Tools like Split allows you to instantly disable it, without the need for a new deployment. This not only minimizes the impact of errors in production but also gives your team the confidence to experiment more quickly and safely. ðŸš€

The Dark Side of A/B Testing: Code Complexity
Itâ€™s not all perfect. These benefits also come with technical complexity, especially when A/B testing is implemented at scale.
From my experience working at Pods, a platform where users configure the rental and move of containers step by step. We launched multiple experiments to test whether reordering steps, removing options, or adding new ones had an impact on sales.
At first, everything seemed simple: a few feature flags managed through Split to compare versions and measure conversions. But over time, experiments multiplied uncontrollably. Each change introduced new possible combinations, and what started as an optimization became an unmanageable labyrinth of versions.
Uncontrolled Feature Flags: A Recipe for Chaos
One of the main code smells is having too many feature flags affecting the same system flow.
In our case, there were flags to:
âœ… Modify the order of steps.
âœ… Change the design of certain screens.
âœ… Add or remove optional questions.
Each flag affected the user experience differently, meaning there were multiple possible paths within the same flow. Some might argue that the testing strategy was inadequate, but automated tests were not enough.
This led to every deployment requiring exhaustive testing since any change could interfere with another ongoing experiment.
With Split, we could better visualize which experiments were active, but the lack of a clear strategy led to an excessive number of possible combinations. The team ended up spending more time fixing bugs and running smoke tests for all variants than actually analyzing results or building new features.
In the end, the project became unmanageable, and many experiments were abandoned because the maintenance cost outweighed the expected benefits.

How to Identify an Excess of Experiments?
The easiest way to avoid this chaos is to use feature flags only when is truly needed. But since this technique is so powerful, when is it better to just implement a change without a flag?
Here are three signs that feature flags are becoming a problem:
ðŸ”´ Too many flags in the same flow â†’ If each step in a process has multiple active versions, complexity becomes unmanageable.
ðŸ”´ Tests that create more problems than solutions â†’ If validating an experiment takes longer than its expected benefit, itâ€™s time to rethink it.
ðŸ”´ Experiments that never end â†’ If a test has been running for months without clear conclusions, itâ€™s probably better to rely on previous data and move forward.
In the case of Pods, the solution was to simplify experiments:
âœ… Reduce the number of active flags simultaneously.
âœ… Eliminate tests that didnâ€™t impact conversions.
âœ… Implement a "cleanup policy" to prevent flags from accumulating unnecessarily.
The result? A smoother workflow, fewer production errors, and a more effective experimentation strategy.
ðŸ’¡ Split as an Ally â†’ Split made this process easier by offering centralized experiment management. It allows teams to visualize active tests and remove them when they are no longer valuable, preventing the codebase from becoming cluttered with unnecessary flags.

Conclusion
A/B testing is a powerful strategy for making data-driven decisions and improving digital products. However, its implementation can become complex and difficult to maintain. If experiments accumulate without control, the code becomes hard to manage, development times increase, and the expected benefits disappear.
More experiments donâ€™t always mean better results. Itâ€™s crucial to define when itâ€™s worth testing a variation and when itâ€™s better to simply make the change.
While feature flags are a great tool, their use must be strategic. Balancing experimentation with simplicity is the key to making the most of A/B testing without falling into chaos. ðŸš€
